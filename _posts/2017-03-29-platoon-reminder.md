## What's Platoon
Platoon is a Multi-GPU mini-framework for Theano, that can be found in [github](https://github.com/cshanbo/platoon).

I'm one of the developers of Platoon. The current usable version is in [this branch](https://github.com/cshanbo/platoon/tree/fix/multi-node).

## Attention
Always importing `Platoon`-related components `BEFORE` importing `Theano`


## TODO
1. Testing the current codes to ensure stability
2. More details in README and more examples.
3. Merging the `dev` branch to `master` after tests done
